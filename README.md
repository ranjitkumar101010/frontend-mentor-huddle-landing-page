# frontend-mentor-huddle-landing-page
A simple and responsive Huddle landing page with a single introductory section. This challenge helped me practice working with a two-column layout, improving my Flexbox skills, and ensuring a clean, modern design. Perfect for beginners looking to build their HTML and CSS fundamentals! ðŸš€
